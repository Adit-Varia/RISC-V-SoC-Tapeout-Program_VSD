Steps for Building Real Hardware from C Code to Tapeout
This document outlines the complete process of transforming a high-level C testbench into real hardware, and eventually taping out a chip. The workflow involves software verification, RTL generation, SoC integration, and physical design.
________________________________________
1. Mapping the C Testbench
•	Start with a C code implementation (e.g., a simple calculator program).
•	Compile the code using a standard compiler such as GCC, producing an output file (O0).
•	Next, compile the same code using a spec C compiler targeted for the chosen architecture (in our case, RISC-V), producing another output (O1).
•	Compare O0 and O1 to ensure both outputs match. This step verifies the correctness of the compiler mapping and ensures the specification is correct.

2. Software-to-Hardware Translation
•	Once the specification is verified, the next step is to describe the hardware.
•	The C code is used to generate RTL (Register Transfer Level) representation, typically in Verilog (but other intermediate hardware languages such as Chisel can also be used).
•	A verification check is performed to ensure that the RTL-generated output (O2) matches the earlier spec compiler output (O1).

3. Hardware Partitioning
The RTL hardware description is divided into two major parts:
•	Processor
o	Must be synthesizable (i.e., convertible to gate-level netlists).
o	This ensures that it can be implemented in silicon.
•	Peripherals
o	These support the processor and are also described in code.
o	They can be further divided into:
	Macros: Reusable hardware blocks used multiple times in the design.
	Analog IPs: Required for handling analog signals. Components like ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) bridge the analog-digital gap.

4. SoC Integration
•	At this stage, the processor and peripherals are integrated into a complete System-on-Chip (SoC).
•	The engineer connects the components via GPIO pins and performs system-level checks.
•	This produces another verified output (O3).

5. Physical Design
•	The verified RTL undergoes an RTL-to-GDS flow to generate the GDSII file (industry-standard format for chip layouts).
•	The physical design flow includes:
o	Logic synthesis
o	Placement and routing
o	Timing closure
o	Power optimization

6. Verification and Tapeout
•	The GDSII file is subjected to two essential checks:
o	DRC (Design Rule Check): Ensures compliance with foundry design rules.
o	LVS (Layout vs. Schematic): Confirms that the layout matches the original RTL/netlist.
•	After passing these checks, the design is sent to the foundry.
•	The final step is the tapeout, where the physical chip is manufactured.

Summary Workflow
1.	Map C testbench → Verify outputs (O0 vs O1)
2.	Generate RTL → Verify outputs (O1 vs O2)
3.	Partition into Processor + Peripherals (Macros, Analog IPs)
4.	Perform SoC Integration → Output (O3)
5.	Run RTL-to-GDS flow → Generate GDSII
6.	Perform DRC & LVS checks → Send to foundry → Tapeout
